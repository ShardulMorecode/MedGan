Key Strategies for Better Output
1️⃣ Increase Training Epochs (But Monitor Loss Carefully)
Right now, 5 epochs is too low for a GAN to fully converge.
Try increasing to 30-50 epochs but watch the loss values carefully.
If D Loss → 0 and G Loss → high, your Generator is too weak → Adjust training balance.
2️⃣ Use a Lower Learning Rate
Currently: lr=0.0002
Try lowering it to 0.0001 or even 0.00005 to allow the model to learn more fine details.
Slower learning prevents the GAN from collapsing (Generator producing meaningless outputs).
3️⃣ Use a Better Loss Function for GAN Stability
Right now, we use Binary Cross Entropy (BCE), which is known to be unstable.
Try Wasserstein loss (WGAN) or Least Squares GAN (LSGAN) for more stable training.
4️⃣ Add Noise to Training (Regularization)
GANs sometimes overfit if they see the same data without variations.
Add random noise to input images → Helps model learn better generalization.
5️⃣ Increase Training Data & Use Augmentations
If dataset is small, the model memorizes instead of learning.
Use image augmentations (flipping, rotation, brightness changes).
6️⃣ Use a PatchGAN Discriminator
Your current Discriminator looks at the whole image.
Instead, use PatchGAN (which evaluates local patches) to force the Generator to sharpen small details.
